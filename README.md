# dab_bot
A personal beginner project for learning and experimenting with git and python. A way to convince Jon that dabbing is not something to be ashamed of.

Dab Bot is a bot that will integrate in discord to provide endless entertainment. 

In it's infancy, Dab Bot needs to be able to read and write messages from a discord server. It will initially only perform simple functionalities, including:
* Mocking - Randomly repeating things that Jon says
* Memeing - Randomly injecting memeworthy phrases unsolicited

Eventually, it should:
* Send a message when Jon specifically streams to twitch
* Use a rudimentary AI (i.e. if then blocks) to hold basic conversations just like Jon himself would

Maturing Dab Bot involves being able to configure:
* The frequency of it's activity
* The contents of it's dictionary

I will be connecting Dab Bot to Jira to track feature requests and bug fixes. Please look forward to it.
